# Algorithm Implementations

This directory tracks the implementations of various algorithms covered in "Introduction to Algorithms" book by Thomas Cormen, et.al, as a part of the CSCI 6470 Algorithms course at University of Georgia. The implementations have mainly been carried out in [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) and [Java 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/).
